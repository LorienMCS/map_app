# map_app
A project using Google Maps JavaScript API to design a map showing a few places I think are interesting in San Francisco.

This is a project for the Full Stack Program at [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/full-stack/). The goal for the assignment was to spend three days using our creativity and JS skills to create an app using an external library or technology.

It's been a goal of mine for a while now to create an app detailing nature-related and other interesting spots in San Francisco. This web page, using Google Maps JavaScript API, is my first attempt.

I used and modified a lot of the code and instructions in the [Google Maps JavaScript API Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial). My understanding, from reading the [Google Developers Site Policies](https://developers.google.com/site-policies), is that we are able to use [nearly everything](https://developers.google.com/site-policies#restrictions) on the Google Developers site in our own creations, as long as we include the following attribution:

In the interest of completeness: since I'm also using a lot of their code, here is an additional attribution: I reproduced and modified the Google code from the [Google Maps JavaScript API Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) according to terms described below:

The code and instructions I used came from many different pages in the [Google Maps JavaScript API Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial), so hopefully, linking to the opening page of the tutorial will satisfy the requirement that I link back to the original source page. I am very grateful to Google for the tutorial, and of course also for the opportunity to make use of the Google Maps JavaScript API! It is a dream come true to have even this simple web app, showing a few locations in San Francisco that I think are fun to visit.

A few disclaimers:
- There are an enormous number of comments in my code in this project, particularly in the JavaScript file. I would normally never have this many comments, but this was a school project, and I left the comments in so my fellow students could explore what I learned .
- This is still a work in progress. There is no back end to this project: no database, no web hosting except as a project page on GitHub. The code has not been refactored.
- I have only been studying JavaScript for a month, so there is a lot I still don't know. I look forward to adding features and improvements as I learn more!
